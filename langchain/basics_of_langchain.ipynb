    "## Tour of LangChain 🦜🔗: Building a language model application\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a python \"framework for developing applications powered by language models.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "According to [LangChain's documentation](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), there are **6 key areas** that it is designed to help you with (in order of complexity):\n",
    "\n",
    "**📃 LLMs and Prompts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔗 Chains**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chains go beyond a single LLM call and involve sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📚 Data Augmented Generation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Augmented Generation involves specific types of chains that first interact with an external data source to fetch data for use in the generation step. Examples include summarization of long pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🤖 Agents:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end-to-end agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🧠 Memory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory refers to persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🧐 Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this."

    "## ❓ Choosing a model \n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain allows you to pick from many different types of language models and use them in your application. Pending access resrictions (i.e. paying for an API) you can pick from a [range of LLMs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/) or [chat models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/). \n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth considering things such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Privacy**. Do you want to use a model that is hosted on a server or do you want to use a model that is hosted locally?  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cost**. Do you want to pay for access to a model or do you want to use a free model?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Token window size**. How long will your prompts be? You can use a model that supports a larger token window size if you need to accomodate longer prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **LLMs vs. chat models**. What type of model do you need? LLMs are good for generating text, while chat models are good for having conversations. As LangChain states: _LLMs in LangChain refer to pure text completion models. The APIs they wrap take a string prompt as input and output a string completion. Meanwhile, chat models are often backed by LLMs but tuned specifically for having conversations. And, crucially, their provider APIs expose a different interface than pure text completion models. Instead of a single string, they take a list of chat messages as input._  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll primarily be using OpenAI LLMs and chat models unless otherwise stated."

      "Nikolaus Barbie (25 October 1913 – 25 September 1991) was a German officer of the SS and SD who worked in Vichy France during World War II. He became known as the \"Butcher of Lyon\" for having personally tortured prisoners—primarily Jews and members of the French Resistance—as the head of the Gestapo in Lyon. After the war, United States intelligence services employed him for his anti-communist efforts and aided his escape to Bolivia, where he advised the dictatorial regime on how to repress opposition through torture. In 1983, the United States apologised to France for the U.S. Counterintelligence Corps helping him escape to Bolivia, aiding Barbie's escape from an outstanding arrest warrant.In 1972, it was discovered he was in Bolivia. While in Bolivia, the West German Intelligence Service recruited him. Barbie is suspected of having had a role in the Bolivian coup d'état orchestrated by Luis García Meza in 1980.

    "\n",
    "**RAG** is a new generative paradigm that fuses Large Language Models and traditional Information Retrieval (IR) techniques. We can use a retrieval system for the input prompt to augment the output generated by the LLM. This technique allows us to bypass fine-tuning as we can easily expose the model to external data (non-parametric), instead of having to retrain it on our domain-specific data. There are a number of advantages to RAG including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Easy Knowledge Acquisition.** RAG methods allow can easily acquire knowledge from external sources, improving LLM performance within domain specific tasks.   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Minimal Training Cost.** The only training needed is the indexing of your knowledge base. No fine-tuning necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Sources of Knowledge.**  With RAG, one can make use of multiple sources of knowledge, including those that are baked into the model parameters as well as information contained within many different knowledge bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalability.** Using performant vector databases, we can easily scale RAG to large datasets and handle complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Improved Performance & Reduced Hallucination.** RAG generates more accurate and contextually informed content by leveraging retrieval techniques, reducing the likelihood of generating incorrect or fabricated information.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Overcome Context-Window Limit.** All language models have a fixed length of tokens they can process at once, known as the context-window. Using Retrieval Augmentation, we can overcome this fixed text constraint, allowing the model to incorporate data from larger document collections \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Return Sources.** RAG also offers explainability, which is essential for building trust in LLMs. Unlike a black-box LLM, RAG allows users to read the sources they retrieved and judge their relevance and credibility for themselves.\n",
